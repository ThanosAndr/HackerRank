### Xtreme8.0 - Magic Square

Write a program that checks if the given square is magic (i.e. has the same sum for all rows, columns and diagonals).


#### Input
First line: N , the size of the square  
Next N lines: The square, N space separated integers pre line, representing the entries per each row of the square
 
#### Output 
First line: M , the number of lines that do not sum up to the sum of the main diagonal (i.e. the one that contains the first 
element of the square). If the Square is magic, the program should output 0.  
Next M lines: A sorted (in incremental order ) list of the lines that do not sum up to the sum of the main diagonal. The rows 
are numbered 1,2,…,N; the columns are numbered -1,-2,…,-N; and the antidiagonal is numbered zero.
